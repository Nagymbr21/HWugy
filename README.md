# Simple Static Website

This is a minimal static website scaffold created for you.

Files added:

- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small interaction handlers

How to view locally

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser, or run a local static server.

2. To run a quick local server (requires Python):

```powershell
# from the project folder
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser
```

Next steps

- Customize content in `index.html`.
- Hook the contact form to a backend or service.
- I can deploy this to GitHub Pages or Netlify if you want.
